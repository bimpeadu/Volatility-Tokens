üìÑ README ‚Äì Comprehensive Volatility Token Contract

Overview

The Volatility Token Contract is an advanced Clarity smart contract that creates a fungible token whose value dynamically adjusts based on Bitcoin (BTC) volatility. It integrates token minting, burning, staking, rewards distribution, governance, and oracle-driven price updates. The contract also features emergency controls, volatility decay mechanics, and governance for protocol upgrades.

üîë Key Features

Volatility-Backed Token

Token value adjusts according to BTC price volatility.

Uses a volatility multiplier and index to represent token strength.

Staking & Rewards

Users can stake tokens to earn rewards based on both staked duration and volatility bonuses.

Claim rewards in tokens or compound rewards into staked balance.

Unstake mechanism with a configurable cooldown and two-step request/complete process.

Governance

Token holders with sufficient balance can create proposals.

Weighted voting system based on token balance.

Proposals execute only if quorum and majority conditions are met.

Adjustable governance threshold.

Oracle-Driven BTC Price Feed

Authorized oracle operators and the contract owner can update BTC price.

Freshness checks ensure data reliability.

Emergency fallback price update available if oracle data is stale.

Reward Pool

Centralized reward pool for staking payouts.

Anyone can add to the reward pool.

Emergency Controls

Contract owner can pause/unpause the contract in emergencies.

Operations like staking, unstaking, and transfers are disabled when paused.

Volatility Management

Volatility naturally decays over time to prevent runaway growth.

Token value is adjusted with a minimum threshold and maximum cap.

üìö Contract Components

Data Variables:

Tracks supply, BTC price, volatility, staked balances, reward pool, governance threshold, and emergency state.

Maps:

token-balances ‚Üí user balances

staked-balances ‚Üí staking info (amount, block height, last claim)

price-history ‚Üí BTC price + volatility snapshots

governance-proposals ‚Üí proposals with votes and status

user-votes ‚Üí prevents double voting

oracle-operators ‚Üí list of approved price feeders

unstake-requests ‚Üí two-step unstaking process

Core Functions:

Token: mint-tokens, transfer, burn-tokens, get-adjusted-value

Staking: stake-tokens, unstake-tokens, claim-rewards, compound-rewards, request-unstake, complete-unstake

Governance: create-governance-proposal, vote-on-proposal, execute-proposal, set-governance-threshold

Oracle: update-btc-price, oracle-price-update, emergency-price-update

Emergency: emergency-pause-contract, emergency-unpause-contract

Volatility: calculate-volatility, calculate-volatility-index, decay-volatility

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

BTC Price Updates

Oracles update BTC price regularly.

Volatility is calculated as relative % difference from the previous price.

Volatility Multiplier & Index

Multiplier grows with volatility but decays each block.

Token adjusted value = amount √ó multiplier √∑ 1,000,000.

Staking Rewards

Rewards scale with staked tokens, duration, and current volatility.

Rewards must be claimed or compounded.

Governance

Token holders propose and vote.

Execution requires quorum and majority.

Emergency Mode

Contract owner can freeze operations to protect funds.

‚úÖ Example Use Cases

Token that thrives in high volatility markets (hedge against BTC swings).

Staking with dynamic yield tied to market volatility.

DAO-style governance with economic weight.

Oracle-driven DeFi experiments.

üöÄ Deployment Notes

Must configure oracle operators after deployment.

Governance threshold should be set based on token distribution.

Reward pool must be funded before staking rewards can be claimed.
